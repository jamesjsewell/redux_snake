A clone of the classic game snake. This snake clone is written in React and is using Redux for the higher level game state. The graphics for the game are built using the html canvas. It is essentially a grid of squares and every frame the game logic runs a series of checks on the array of snake squares to see if it has collided with something or eaten the fruit. The rest of the game like the pause menu for example has been styled with a css framework called SemanticUI for React.
